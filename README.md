# 📚 StudyIntel

**StudyIntel** is an AI-powered SaaS platform I’m building solo as a 2nd-year university student. It helps students stop wasting time and start studying smarter. By tracking study habits and visualizing progress, it reveals what’s working and what’s not, so users can stay focused, improve consistently, and reach their academic goals.
